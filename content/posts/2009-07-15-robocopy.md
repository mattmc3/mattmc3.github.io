Apparently I've been asleep at the command-line wheel. I was told today about [a tool](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/blogs/tims/the-coolest-command-line-tool-in-windows-vista) that Vista includes free, and I cannot figure out how I lived without it: [robocopy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robocopy).

I've been using [SyncToy](https://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/microsoft_synctoy_for_windows_xp.html) with mixed results. No more.

See [this great article](https://web.archive.org/web/20080920014134/http://blogs.techrepublic.com.com/window-on-windows/?p=777) for some robust copying goodness.

_PS: yes, I do know about Cygwin + rsync._
