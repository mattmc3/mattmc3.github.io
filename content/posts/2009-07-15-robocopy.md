Apparently I've been asleep at the command-line wheel. I was told today about [a tool](http://blogs.msdn.com/tims/archive/2006/09/07/the-coolest-command-line-tool-in-windows-vista.aspx) that Vista includes free, and I cannot figure out how I lived without it: [robocopy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robocopy).

I've been using [SyncToy](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;FamilyID=c26efa36-98e0-4ee9-a7c5-98d0592d8c52) with mixed results. No more.

See [this great article](http://blogs.techrepublic.com.com/window-on-windows/?p=777) for some robust copying goodness.

_PS: yes, I do know about Cygwin + rsync._
