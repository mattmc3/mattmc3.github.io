i'll admit it. my 4-year bachelor's degree in _computer science and systems analysis_ caused me to really like semicolon languages; and terse-ness; what i mean by that is obvious if you're a programmer; i prefer languages like c/c++, java, and c#; and even javascript; (though you can **cheat** with the semicolons with js, but i never do; true faithfulness); but c#, though i love thee, we can agree to disagree about curly brace placement. _i don't care what the other dads do, you braces don't get your own line just to open a code block_; **period.** er, semicolon;

But `My` Job Now `Is` Wholly VB.NET. So Now I Can Type `In` Any `Case` I Darn Well Please `And` Auto-Formatting Will Take Care `Of` It. `AndAlso` Everything `Is` A Really `Long` Statement `With` Extra Verbiage `And` Blue Highlights Just `For` The Art `Of` It. `As Long As` I `Dim My` World `AndAlso` Speak Semi-English In Loving But Excessively `Long` Streams `Of` Coding Goodness, `My` Code Will Compile, `OrElse` It Will Tell `Me` Early That It's Sick.

But, But, But...

`If` I'm Not Careful `To` Be _Strict_ `And` _Explicit_ All The Time `Then`
`Integers` Can Be `Strings And Strings Integers.` Which Will Lead `To`, Well... Peter Venkman `From` GhostBusters Said It Best - _"Human Sacrifice... Dogs `And` Cats Living Together... Mass Hysteria!"_ `End If`

In VB, I miss terse-ness, the `yield` statement, multiline comments/strings/statements (the underscore trick has problems), \t, \r, \n, anonymous delegates, not having to tell my code what 'options' I want, and square brackets for array indexers. I especially miss multiline statements - that little trailing underscore doesn't cut it when I want to comment out one part in the middle of my Linq statement! And why not just have made `And` and `Or` short-circuiting operators rather than adding `AndAlso` and `OrElse`? How can VB be so WRONG about those things?! I love C#.

In C#, I miss case-insensitivity, inline XML, single equals for comparison, being curly brace free (square braces can stay though), the `With` statement, the `End` keyword combos rather than }'s, and automatic-background-compilation. _Especially_ automatic-background-compilation - CTRL+SHIFT+B is wearing out on my keyboard! And, I mean **really** - tell me why character casing matter to humans again?! It's only easier for the computers! How can C# be so WRONG about those things!? I love VB.

Much like my two little boys. One's a little sensitive, and one's a little stubborn. One likes Batman, the other Superman. One's got brown hair and the other's a tow head. One's a dreamer, the other a great friend. One's got an infectious laugh and the other's got an infectious smile. They're both so different... but so much the same. Brothers. No favorites, just beautiful diversity. Blessings abound.
